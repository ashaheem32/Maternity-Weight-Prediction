üß≠ Project Overview

This project explores a baby weights dataset and builds baseline machine learning models to predict newborn weight using prenatal and maternal features. The included notebook performs:
	‚Ä¢	Data loading and cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
	‚Ä¢	Feature engineering and preprocessing (encoding, scaling, handling missing values)
	‚Ä¢	Training of baseline regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
	‚Ä¢	Model evaluation with regression metrics (MAE, RMSE, R¬≤)
	‚Ä¢	Short discussion of results and next steps

Note: I attempted to read the notebook contents from GitHub but the repository page returned an error during loading. This README uses typical structure and placeholders ‚Äî please update the Modeling and Results sections below with exact model names and metrics from your notebook if they differ.

üßæ Dataset
	‚Ä¢	File: baby-weights-dataset.csv (included in the repo)
	‚Ä¢	Description: See data-description.txt for column definitions and dataset notes.
	‚Ä¢	Licensing / Source: If you used an external source for the dataset, add the original source and license here.

üöÄ How to run

Option A ‚Äî Run locally
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ashaheem32/Maternity-Weight-Prediction.git
cd Maternity-Weight-Prediction

	2.	Create & activate a Python environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

	3.	Install dependencies (example):

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don‚Äôt have a requirements.txt, create one containing packages used in the notebook. Typical dependencies:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
ipykernel

	4.	Start Jupyter and open the notebook:

jupyter notebook
# then open `Weight_ Prediction .ipynb`

Option B ‚Äî Run in Google Colab
	1.	Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com
	2.	Upload the notebook file (Weight_ Prediction .ipynb) or open it from GitHub using the GitHub tab.
	3.	Upload baby-weights-dataset.csv to the Colab session or mount your Google Drive and update the notebook data path accordingly.

üß™ Notebook summary (placeholder)

Sections included (expected):
	1.	Data import & preview
	2.	Data cleaning (missing values, outliers)
	3.	Exploratory plots (distributions, correlations)
	4.	Feature engineering (one-hot / ordinal encoding, scaling)
	5.	Model training & evaluation
	6.	Conclusion & next steps

Models trained (replace with actual):
	‚Ä¢	Linear Regression
	‚Ä¢	Decision Tree Regressor
	‚Ä¢	Random Forest Regressor

Example evaluation metrics (replace with your actual results):

Model	MAE	RMSE	R¬≤
Linear Regression	0.45	0.60	0.62
Random Forest	0.35	0.48	0.75

Please update the table above with the true metrics from Weight_ Prediction .ipynb.

üîß Recommendations & next steps
	‚Ä¢	Try additional models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM)
	‚Ä¢	Feature selection and cross-validation (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)
	‚Ä¢	Calibrate pipelines and persist best model with joblib or pickle.
	‚Ä¢	Create a small web demo (Flask/FastAPI + a lightweight frontend) to showcase predictions.

Final notes
	‚Ä¢	I created this README using the repository structure visible on GitHub. I couldn‚Äôt fully load the notebook contents due to a temporary GitHub page error ‚Äî to make the README exact, please update the Notebook summary, Models trained, and Example evaluation metrics sections with the actual content from Weight_ Prediction .ipynb.
